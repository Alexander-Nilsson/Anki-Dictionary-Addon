‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exporters/          # Export functionality
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ web/                # Web-related components

assets/                  # Asset files (templates, styles, scripts, icons)

## üîß Development

The addon follows modern Python development practices with a clean, modular structure:

1. **Development Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd anki-dictionary-addon
   
   # Install dependencies (using uv for fast package management)
   uv sync
   
   # Or use pip if you prefer
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Project Structure:**
   - `src/anki_dictionary/` - Main package with all source code
   - `assets/` - Templates, styles, scripts, and icons
   - `standalone/` - Standalone launcher components
   - `docs/` - Documentation and guides
   - `tests/` - Test suite (to be expanded)

3. **Development Workflow:**
   ```bash
   # Test the package structure
   python test_structure.py
   
   # Run standalone mode for testing
   python launch_dictionary.py
   
   # Run with specific Python environment
   uv run python launch_dictionary.py
   ```

4. **Code Organization:**
   - Follow the package structure for new features
   - Keep related functionality grouped together
   - Use absolute imports within the package
   - Document new functions and classes

See [docs/REORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md](docs/REORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed information about the project structure.
