# Minimal requirements for running Anki Dictionary Addon without full Anki application
# These are the essential dependencies needed to run the addon directly

# Core Anki components (required)
anki>=2.1.50,<2.2.0

# Qt components for the UI (required)
PyQt6>=6.4.0,<7.0.0
PyQt6-WebEngine>=6.4.0,<7.0.0

# Note: Many vendor dependencies are already included in the addon's vendor/ folder
# This keeps external dependencies to a minimum

# Optional: For audio support (uncomment if needed)
# pygame>=2.0.0,<3.0.0

# If you encounter import errors, you may need additional Anki dependencies:
# pip install anki[qt]
